# pocket
Personal Finance Application. This application aims to help individuals setup budget and understand their spending habits. It is built as a learning experience focusing on:


## Low level Java API
As the program needs to interface with a database, JDBC was used instead of ORM

## Design Patterns
So to understand basic enterprise design patterns in a real project

## Abstract Implementation
So that the application can work on a PC (or any system that has an available JVM) as well as Android
